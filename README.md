## About Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Hi, I'm Lisa.  I am kind of nerdy about tech but I'm also pretty nerdy about a lot of other topics like running, native plants and cooking.  I grew up on a 250 acre beef farm and while I've never herded cats (which I'm frequently labeled as doing well), I have in fact herded cattle on many occassions.  I learned to write code in high school and it was the only class I really loved and so I've happily spent my career getting as close to software developers as I can while avoiding actually writing code.  I have a diploma that says I am a Computer Programmer Analyst and a degree that says Bachelor of Business Administration and I'm happy right in the middle of those two areas.

## How to Contact Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Slack and verbal are my favourite ways to communicate.  If you try to get me by email you may wait until 'infinity and beyond' for a response.  If for some reason you need me outside of regular hours my text number is in my slack profile.  Feel free to book 'working sessions' in my calendar or informal chats.  If in person a walk to grab a tea is also great and if virtual I'm happy to have 'virtual tea' at any time to chat.

## Preferred Working Style

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I'm focused on work typically between 8:30 am and 5pm eastern time - these are the best hours to reach me.  I sometimes catch up in the evenings but am never looking for responses from others when I choose to work odd hours.  Before work I'm usually prepping dinner and herding my kids to their buses and at noon and 5 my dogs assertively remind me that it's time for a walk so I'm pretty strict on taking lunch away from my desk and signing off by 5 or 5:30pm.

## What Motivates Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I LOVE helping others be successful.  I believe in servant leadership, this is fundamental to how I work and see the world.  Seeing individuals and teams build great things and feel motivated and accomplished is what gets me out of bed in the morning.  I love when others can stand in the spotlight and enjoy a standing ovation while I remain in the shadows - proud of any small role I was able to play in getting them to where they are.  I am deeply uncomfortable standing in the spotlight myself however as a female in tech I will brace myself for the discomfort and stand smiling in a spotlight if I believe it will pave the road for other women or underrepresented groups.

## What Demotivates Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I love the feeling of accomplishment, I get weighed down by all talk and no action.  I love innovating and moving forward and continuous improvement.  I feel demotivated in a place where we repeat the same mistakes, or work on things for long periods without tangible progress.  I am unhappy in an environment where people disrespect one another, lay blame instead of identifying root cause, or generally engage in behaviours that erode psychological safety.

## My Values (and what I value in others)

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I love optimism and positivity but appreciate healthy doses of realism too.  I have an odd sense of humour and appreciate a quirky joke.  Diversity, equity and inclusion are close to my heart which includes an expectation that people treat one another with respect and 'come to the table' with an open mind and readiness to appreciate our differences.  I am wildly curious about everything and love learning about others and about just about every topic out there.  If you love investing or black holes or history or ethics in articial intelligence, or whatever,  I want to hear about it!

## My Blind Spots

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I have a quick temper although thankfully age continues to mellow this quality.  I am highly open to change, because I am willing to change anything at any time if I believe it's best for a team, I can come across as inconsistent.  I see everything as a continuous experiment "sure, let's try it for 2 weeks and then get feedback about how it went" is a phrase you may frequently hear from me.  
    I also am hard wired to skip 'small talk', my value of punctuality and effectiveness can mean I forget to leave time for people to chat and connect.  If you catch me time managing the fun out of everything - go ahead and call me on it.  I love connecting with people and engaging in small talk - I just forget to initiate it or become so focused on productivity that it slips my mind!

## My Pet Peeves

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Meetings that run longer than their time box :(
Being a jerk.  We should be able to disagree and debate and have conflict but still grab lunch together because we respect one another and can find common ground.

## Other

<details>


-   "How I like myÂ 1:1s" - 1:1's are about us connecting, getting to know one another, and having time to cover anything from what is on your mind to your career goals 3 years from now.  I love throwing in more abstract questions that steer away from day to day and towards understanding people better, and what they want in their role/career.  If I can support you/unblock you let me know because helping others succeed is what I love doing most.  If I can be a good listener or a coach I will look for those opportunities too.
-   "Quirks" - I am sarcastic, it's not my best quality.  I've tried to be less sarcastic since my teens but it's a hard one to kick.  I often make sarcastic comments with a straight face and that can be problematic.  I like to believe my sarcastic nature is charming and lovable but rest assured my family have informed me that it's neither charming, nor lovable.
-   "How to interpret my calendar" - If my calendar looks crazy full please note that I also keep my personal calendar in my work calendar because I'd be a walking disaster if I had to constantly check two different calendars.  Sometimes time is blocked out but I am in fact available or I can move things around.  Helping others be successful is what motivates me so just check with me for a spot - I'll make time to connect!
-   "What you can expect from me" - I care a lot.  I love feedback and blindly assume others do too.  If I offer up unsoliticed coaching then know it comes from a good place.  I have high expectations of myself and others and operate on the belief that people are doing the best they can with what they have and that they always have good motives.
