## About Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Hi, I'm Lisa.  I am kind of nerdy about tech but I'm also pretty nerdy about a lot of other topics like running, native plants and cooking.  I grew up on a 250 acre beef farm and while I've never herded cats (which I'm frequently labeled as doing well), I have in fact herded cattle on many occassions.  I learned to write code in high school and it was the only class I really loved and so I've happily spent my career getting as close to software developers as I can while avoiding writing code whenever possible.  I have a diploma that says I am a Computer Programmer Analyst and a degree that says Bachelor of Business Administration and I'm happy right in the middle of those two areas.

## How to Contact Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Slack and verbal are my favourite ways to communicate.  If you try to get me by email you may wait until infinity for a response.  If for some reason you need me outside of regular hours my text number is in my slack profile.  Feel free to book 'working sessions' in my calendar or informal chats.  If in person a walk to grab a tea is also great and if virtual I'm happy tohave 'virtual tea' at any time to chat.

## Preferred Working Style

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I'm focused on work typically between 8:30 am and 5pm eastern time - these are the best hours to reach me during.  I sometimes catch up in the evenings but am never lookingn for responses from others when I choose to work odd hours.  Before work I'm usually prepping dinner and herding my kids to their buses and at noon and 5 my dogs assertively remind me that it's time for a walk so I'm pretty strict on taking lunch away from my desk and signing off by 5 or 5:30pm.

## What Motivates Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I LOVE helping others be successful.  I believe in servant leadership, this is fundamental to how I work and see the world.  Seeing individuals and teams build great things and feel motivated and accomplished is what gets me out of bed in the morning.  I love when others can stand in the spotlight and enjoy a standing ovation while I hover in the shadows - proud of any small role I was able to play in getting them to where they are.  I am deeply uncomfortable standing in the spotlight myself however as a female in tech I will brace myself for the discomfort and stand smiling in a spotlight if I believe it will pave the road for other women or underrepresented groups.

## What Demotivates Me

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I love the feeling of accomplishment, I get weighed down by all talk and no action.  I love innovating and moving forward and continuous improvement.  I feel demotivated in a place where we repeat the same mistakes, or work on things for long periods without tangible progress.  I am unhappy in an environment where people disrespect one another, lay blame instead of identifying root cause, or generally engage in behaviours that erode psychological safety.

## My Values (and what I value in others)

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I love optimism and positivity but appreciate healthy doses of realism too.  I have an odd sense of humour and appreciate a quirky joke.  Diversity, equity and inclusion are close to my heart which includes an expectation that people treat one another with respect and 'come to the table' with an open mind and readiness to appreciate our differences.  I am wildly curious about everything and love learning.

## My Blind Spots

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I have a quick temper although thankfully age continues to mellow this quality.  I am highly open to change, because I am willing to change anything at any time if I believe it's best for a team I can come across as inconsistent.  I am also highly adaptable and enjoy wearing many hats but the downside of this is that I can be willing to adapt even if a situation better called for rigidity.  I love feedback and believe I can learn from everyone so please let me know what blind spots you see in me.  
    I also am hard wired to skip 'small talk', my value of punctuality and effectiveness can mean I forget to leave time for people to chat and connect.  If you catch me time managing the fun out of everything - go ahead and call me on it.  I love connecting with people and engaging in small talk - I just forget to initiate it or become so focused on productivity that it slips my mind!

## My Pet Peeves

<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: It might be tempting to use this section to vent, that's absolutely fine but the more constructive the better. If there are simple things people can reasonably avoid doing, then list them here. Bear in mind that you will also need to also read your squad members' pet peeves section, it's a 2 way street.

## Other

<details>


-   "How I like myÂ 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
-   "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
-   "How to interpret my calendar" - If my calendar looks crazy full please note that I also keep my personal calendar in my work calendar because I'd be a walking disaster if I had to constantly check two different calendars.  Sometimes time is blocked out but I am in fact available or I can move things around.  Helping others be successful is what motivates me so just check with me for a spot - I'll make time to connect!
-   "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
